## üåê Next Steps: Manual Deployment

Since CLI authentication is experiencing issues, follow these steps for web-based deployment:

### Step 1: Accept Project Invitation
1. Visit: https://railway.com/invite/Oj4C7QjMvRR
2. Accept the invitation to join the project
3. You'll be redirected to the Railway dashboard

### Step 2: Deploy Your Application
1. In the Railway dashboard, select the **charismatic-light** project
2. Click **"New Service"** ‚Üí **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository (you may need to push your code to GitHub first)
4. Set **Root Directory** to `/` (project root)
5. Railway will automatically detect your `Dockerfile` and `railway.toml`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
In the Railway dashboard, go to your service settings and add these environment variables:

```bash
# Required for OpenAI integration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Application Settings
ENVIRONMENT=production

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
MONGO_URL=mongodb://...
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Monitor
1. Click **"Deploy"** to start the deployment
2. Monitor the build logs in the Railway dashboard
3. Once deployed, your API will be available at:
   ```
   https://charismatic-light-production.up.railway.app
   ```

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check

```

## üîÑ Alternative: GitHub Integration

If you prefer automated deployments:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Railway:**
   - In Railway dashboard, select "GitHub Repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will automatically deploy on every push

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

- **Logs:** Available in Railway dashboard under your service
- **Metrics:** CPU, memory, and network usage in the dashboard
- **Health Checks:** Configured to check `/health` endpoint
- **Auto-restart:** Configured to restart on failure (max 10 retries)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures:**
   - Check that all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax
   - Check build logs in Railway dashboard

2. **Runtime Errors:**
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Check application logs in Railway dashboard
   - Ensure OpenAI API key is valid

3. **Port Issues:**
   - Railway automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable
   - Your app should bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
   - Current configuration: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway documentation: https://docs.railway.app
2. Review build and runtime logs in the dashboard
3. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
4. Test locally with the same environment variables
